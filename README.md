The purpose of this repo is to give a visual representation of the available schools in Philadelphia neighbourhoods.

The user may enter a starting location, and ending location and play with the map options to detect how many public schools are accessible within a certain travel time distance(period).

I uploaded a beta version of the application to http://thesilentcamera.com/test/phillyschools

The page will show two links:
1- The first link shows a web page with text boxes to enter the desired start and end locations. It lets the user enter their desired addresses
and find schools that fall within the desired commute duration.

2- The second link shows a heat(commute duration) map around any given school.
