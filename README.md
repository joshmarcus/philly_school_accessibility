The purpose of this repo is to give a visual representation of the available schools in Philadelphia neighbourhoods.

The user may enter a starting location, and ending location and play with the map options to detect how many public schools are accessible within a certain travel time distance(period).

I uploaded a beta version of the application to http://thesilentcamera.com/test/phillyschools
